## Objective

BudgetMate is a web application which will help you to manage your finances and your family members expenses. BudgetMate provides a functionality to create multiple accounts, budgets and add different type of records such as expenses, incomes, and transfers between accounts. 

You can share your accounts with other users. Even though your balance will always be visible, you wonâ€™t have access to other users expense, income records. We provide an extensive search options for your recordsâ€™ history as well extensive analytics for each month. This will help you to summarize monthly earnings and expenses.

## Application Stack

The application is divided into two main service [budgetmate-v2-api](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/spring-backend) and [budgetmate-v2-app](https://gitlab.com/kdg-ti/programming-5/projects-24-25/acs202/robert.sargsyan/Client). 

The API service contains Rest APIs. The APIs are completely stateless, meaning that it uses JWT token to authenticate users. You can find quickly check the APIs markdown file here or open a documentation using this [link](http://app.budgetmate.com/swagger-ui/index.html). (Please note that the application should be run in order to open OpenAPI documentation). Our persistence layer which uses PostgreSQL follows all ACID principles.

The APP service contains the codebase for the applicationâ€™s frontend. We currently use plain JS, CSS and HTML to support user interaction and the user interface in general but in the future we will migrate to React framework. 

The demo user accountâ€™s credentials are:

`email: user@budgetmate.com
password: user123`
